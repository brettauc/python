## PyBank
Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company.  The financial dataset for the analysis is stored in this file [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv).

Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The results of the analysis will print to the terminal and export to a text file.


## PyRamen
Analyze business financial performance by cross-referencing sales data with internal menu data to figure out revenues and costs for the year.

Also analyze how well the business did on a per-product basis in order to better understand which products are doing well, which are doing poorly, and, ultimately, which products may need to be removed or changed.

Write out the contents of the `report` dictionary to a text file. The report should output each ramen type as the keys and `01-count`, `02-revenue`, `03-cogs`, and `04-profit` metrics as the values for every ramen type.
